This is my first experience with the simplest dataset in Kaggle - Titanic competition 
I did that for the educational purpose

Feel free to take this code and modify it to get better results!

There are part that do imputations of missing data
DesicionTreeClassifier and XGBoostClassifier got me only to top 50%

Appying keras for the same training set got me 0.80382 score or top 8%
